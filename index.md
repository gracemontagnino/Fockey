# Analysis
We are able to evalute the success of an Indian Dribble, by breaking it down into four components: speed, consistency, levelness, and accuracy of rotations. 
## Speed
## Consistency
## Levelness
In our case, yaw measured how far off the line the stick went. To make your dribble as good as possible, you want to minimize any movement in this direction. Looking at a graph of the yaw, you will notice the sinusoidal shape. It is a sinusoid and not a straight line due to the turns at each end of the dribble, but a good drill has a very subtle sinusoidal curve. To put this into a metric, we found the peaks and valleys of our yaw curve, and foudn their difference. We then put those differences into a scale based off of which difference were closest to ideal, and which ones needed the most coaching. Below are two examples, one of a fairly level drill, and one that wavered more in the yaw.

As shown by the graphs, the more subtle the curve, the better the score.
## Accurate Rotations
An ideal Indian Dribble takes the stick from a 90 degree angle, with the end of the stick pointing away from you, all the way around to a 270 degree angle, where the end of the stick is facing you.
